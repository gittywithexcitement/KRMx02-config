X axis
------------------
MAX_VELOCITY = 6.33372173958

MAX_ACCELERATION = 40.0
STEPGEN_MAXACCEL = 50.0
OK

MAX_ACCELERATION = 60.0
STEPGEN_MAXACCEL = 75.0
OK

MAX_ACCELERATION = 80.0
STEPGEN_MAXACCEL = 100.0
OK

### At this point I think I should try higher velocity values

MAX_VELOCITY = 19.0006813407
MAX_ACCELERATION = 80.0
STEPGEN_MAXACCEL = 100.0
OK
1140 ipm

MAX_VELOCITY = 28.5004776725
MAX_ACCELERATION = 80.0
STEPGEN_MAXACCEL = 100.0
cant test because acceleration isn't high enough

It looks like it's not traveling the full distance. It's told to move to x0 but it actually stops at x2 instead...
